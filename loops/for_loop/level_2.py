# 6️⃣ Count how many even numbers between 1 and 100
# count=0
# for num in range(1,101):
#     if num%2==0:
#         count +=1
        
# print('even numbers between 1 and 100 : ',count)


# 7️⃣ Count how many odd numbers between 1 and 100

# count=0
# for num in range (1,101):
#     if num%2 != 0:
#         count +=1

# print('odd numbers between 1 and 100 : ',count)


# 8️⃣ Print numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3

# for num in range (1,101):
#     if num%3==0:
